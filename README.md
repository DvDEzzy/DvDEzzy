Hey your probably here to see my program. Because of it's niche use it may be a bit hard to understand and the program isn't finished and should have a more interactive
interface. Currently it can give code which gives trading signals according to the MACD strategy aswell as being able to backtest the MACD strategy on different trading 
charts

Instructions:
Click on open MACD Strategy
Copy the code in the pastebin
Go to tradingview and paste in the strategy
Enjoy
